# optimCheck: Graphical and numerical checks for mode-finding routines

*Martin Lysy*

---

### Description

Tools for checking that the output of an optimization algorithm is indeed at a local mode of the objective function.  This is accomplished graphically by calculating all one-dimensional "projection plots" of the objective function, i.e., varying each input variable one at a time with all other elements of the potential solution being fixed.  The numerical values in these plots can be readily extracted for the purpose of automated and systematic unit-testing of optimization routines.

### Installation

Install the R [**devtools**](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) package and run
```{r}
devtools::install_github("mlysy/optimCheck")
```

### Usage

A quick tutorial is provided by the package vignette: `vignette("optimCheck")`.
