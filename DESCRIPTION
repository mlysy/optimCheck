Description: Tools for checking that the output of an optimization algorithm is indeed at a local mode of the objective function.  This is accomplished graphically by calculating all one-dimensional "projection plots" of the objective function, i.e., varying each input variable one at a time with all other elements of the potential solution being fixed.  The numerical values in these plots can be readily extracted for the purpose of automated and systematic unit-testing of optimization routines.
